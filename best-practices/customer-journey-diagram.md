# Customer journey / diagram

Based on the use case, the user profile, other user insights, the subject matter expertise and the business goals, a customer journey map for the conversational assistant is a helpful way to put a next level of detail (albeit still high level) in place.&#x20;

Depending on the size and complexity of the assistant, this may look more like a diagram than a customer journey.&#x20;

Imagine an assistant that serves as a mental health mentor. The assistant consists of a number of therapy sessions, and each covers a specific topic and has a few activities per topic. This type of high-level structure lends itself well to a customer journey map.&#x20;

Imagine on the other hand an assistant that allows you to confirm or cancel an appointment. For appointment confirmation, the assistant needs to check a number of items before your appointment can be confirmed, and for each of those items, an alternate path is available. A journey map might quickly become unwieldy, and a diagram might be a better visualization.&#x20;

The map or diagram is an important step towards the actual structure for implementation in OpenDialog, as we'll see in the upcoming "Conversation Structure" section.&#x20;
