# Types of repair

There are many ways in which a conversation can break down, and as a result there are many types of repair. From a linguistic point of view, here are some of the most common triggers of a repair pattern. The response to each type will depend on content and use case.

### General

* What?
* I don’t get it
* That’s not what I asked

### Definition request

* What is pronation?
* What is a cross-trainer?

### Repeat request

* What did you say?&#x20;
* Can you repeat that?

### Partial repeat request

* Size 10 what?

### Paraphrase request

* What do you mean?&#x20;
* Can you say that another way?

### Example request

* What are my options?&#x20;
* What shoe brands do you carry other than Nike?

### Understanding check

* Delectable means delicious?
* Flan is a dessert?

### Confirmation check

* A pizza with pineapple and papaya?

### Correction

* Self-correction: “What sizes are the boots- _er- shoes_ available in?”
* Other-correction:&#x20;

`A: They’re gonna drive back Wednesday.`&#x20;

`B:`` `_`Tomorrow.`_&#x20;

`A: Right, tomorrow.`



`A: How much do the Nikes in size 7 cost?`

`B: The Nike Air Max in size 7 costs $100.`&#x20;

`A:`` `_`Oh I thought those were $80.`_&#x20;

`B: The Nike Air in size 7 costs $80.`&#x20;

`A: Oh okay.`

### Hearing check \[voice only]

* I didn’t hear that

## Dimensions of repair&#x20;

* User-initiated vs. agent-initiated repair (who triggers repair?)&#x20;
* User-repair vs. agent-repair (who fixes the problem?)&#x20;
* Repair sequencing: What if an initial repair doesn’t work? How can you combine them? Looping through different repair strategies, fallback options, scaling up to agent-transfer.&#x20;
  * There could be different fallback strategies. Perhaps, a definition request could be answered, but if that doesn’t work, then use the general repair strategy, and if that doesn’t work, offer to transfer. Alternatively, a user could say a general “I don’t get it”, to which you could respond with a paraphrase.
