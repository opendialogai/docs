## Research Highlights

Mostly, guidelines talk about Grice’s maxims, or speak in generalities. [Greg Bennett](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/chatbot-conversational-style-f7b1d584fb1d) says to fit the closing to the context, fitting the style of your bot. [Google](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/learn-about-conversation) doesn’t address closings specifically. A [contact center blog](https://www.providesupport.com/blog/customer-service-tips-how-to-close-conversation/) says not to leave the conversation before the user; 1) if wrapping up, say thank you and goodbye; 2) if transferring, notify the user; 3) if chat is left open (or a long delay?), ask if the user needs more assistance. Another [live chat blog](https://www.comm100.com/blog/ending-a-chat.html) emphasizes the importance of the pre-closing (without using that term), including a last topic check, gratitude, and future contact orientation. One [blog post](https://medium.com/the-chatbot-guru/chatbotexitsequence-7c45219e77a7) encourages including an exit button, recognizing a user’s “exit” intent, and a task completion closing flow.
