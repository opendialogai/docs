# Account Security

To improve the security of your OpenDialog instance, each user is able to individually set up and use 2 factor authentication on their accounts. In the future, once there is role based access, we will be able to allow admins to set organization wide policies such as 2FA required for all users.

We have no affinity with any specific authenticator apps, so you can use apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, LastPass etc.&#x20;

### Setting up your 2FA

So you now want to secure you account with 2FA! Firstly you need to click on your name to open the user menu in the navigation.

Then click on 'Identity & Security' to open the user security page. To then enable 2FA, click on 'Enable 2FA' to open up the 2FA menu.&#x20;

**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that you scan the QR code, register it and back-up your recovery codes before clicking on 'Confirm'. You can 'Cancel' if you do not wish to proceed.
{% endhint %}

Once setup you will now need your chosen authenticator application to hand when logging in to your account.&#x20;

To deactivate, you will need to login to your account and click on disable.&#x20;



### Locked out of your account

If you get locked out of your account due to 2FA or you forget your email, you can request for the account to be unblocked by following the steps below:

1. Contact [Support@OpenDialog.ai](<mailto:Support@OpenDialog.ai >) and incl. your instance ID within the email.
2. Once the email is received the OpenDialog customer support team will be in touch to confirm a few details from your account.
3. Once completed, we will unblock your account.
