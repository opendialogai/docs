# Creating and managing users

On setup, there will be at least one user in the workspace. Any users may add additional users.&#x20;

### Adding a new user

To enable the members of your team to access the instance, you will have to add them as users on your OpenDialog account.&#x20;

Note that users are added to the workspace, not to a specific scenario.&#x20;

To do this you need to use a "hidden" page by adding "/users" to the URL after "/admin". E.g. `<instance-name>.cloud.opendialog.ai/admin/users.`Next click on the 'Create' button, fill out their details and click 'Create'.&#x20;

Once you've set up the new user account you need to notify the user directly and inform them, since NO email is automatically sent out.&#x20;

Instruct the user to

* Go to your instance URL e.g. `<instance-name>.cloud.opendialog.ai`&#x20;
* Click on the 'I forgot my password' link to set up their password and log in
