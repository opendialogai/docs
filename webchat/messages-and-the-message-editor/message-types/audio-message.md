# Audio Message

## When to use audio messages

Audio messages have many applications:

* **Hands-Free Interaction**: In scenarios where users need a hands-free experience, such as multi-tasking or on the go, audio output provides a convenient alternative.
* **Accessibility**: For users with visual impairments, audio messages offer a more accessible means of interacting.
* **Audio Descriptions:** Playable audio clips can be used in place of descriptions when diagnosing a problem ( e.g. "Does your car engine sound like this? ðŸ”‰")&#x20;

## How to create an audio message

### Via the custom message in Message Editor

Navigate to the [Message Editor](broken-reference) and create a _Custom Message._ Select `audio-message` from the message type drop down menu and the XML Snippet field will automatically be populated with a code template.

Fill in the template with the [properties ](audio-message.md#properties)of your particular message and when you are happy with it make sure to save your message and test it in the Test Preview chat window.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Saving a message:** Always remember to hit 'Save Message' before closing or navigating away from the edit screen.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you change your mind and select a different message type after generating the XML code, the new message code will be appended in the same window so make sure to delete the old message code.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For all message types, a key element to take into consideration is **Accessibility**, especially for messages that include customisation with multimedia types such as buttons, images and links. For all information on accessibility within OpenDialog, please click [here](../../designing-accessible-chatbots.md).
{% endhint %}

#### Properties

`<title>` is the title of your audio clip that appears directly above the message.\
`<url>` a url link to the website where your audio file is being hosted.

#### XML Snippet

```
<audio-message>
  <title>Audio Title</title>
  <url>https://samplelib.com/lib/preview/mp3/sample-9s.mp3</url>
</audio-message>
```

#### Interaction with other message types

Audio messages can be combined with all other message blocks. The only condition is that messages that require a user action be placed last in the message editor. For example button blocks should come after your audio message.
