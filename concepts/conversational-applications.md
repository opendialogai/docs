# Conversational Applications

**OpenDialog** is a framework for building and managing _conversational applications_ to automate, scale and improve processes and interactions between humans and machines. 

A _conversational application_ is an application whose main mode of interaction with the user is through the exchange of messages, which we call _utterances_. Each utterance carries an _intent \(or multiple intents\)_. An intent describes the underlying purpose of the party sending the _utterance_. That purpose or intent can be expressed using any number of different utterances.

The _**conversational engine**_ at the core of OpenDialog provides a way to describe what exchange of intents is useful or expected and provides tools to hook into _intent interpreters_ \(such as NLP tools\) so as to map utterances to those intents and extract other relevant information.

At the same time, the conversational engine allows us to define _actions_ that should take place as a result of an intent being expressed. Actions are the things that will actually change something in the real world and fulfil the overall goal. For the example above the action would be that of creating a checklist for the user to use.

#### Why do you call them conversational applications and not just chatbots?

We use the term _conversation application_ rather than chatbot because chatbot is very wide and, at times, misleading term. It's a bit like calling everything a website. Sure, on a given level _gmail.com_ and _nytimes.com_ are both websites but they serve very different purposes, have very different aims and are built with different sets of priorities governing them.

All conversational applications have chatbots-like characteristics but not all chatbots are conversational applications. We think of conversational applications as predominantly task-oriented. We worry less about being able to sustain any form of dialog or chit chat, or about having to somehow remain true to a _pure_ conversational paradigm where other types of widgets or tools cannot be introduced.

> A conversational application is suitable where a predominantly conversational interaction mode is the best way for a user to use a digital application to solve a problem.

The aim is to minimise the friction in getting tasks done over the appropriate channel \(webchat, Slack, Alexa, Skype, etc\) and automate as much of the underlying process as possible. The way the user communicates with the application happens to be predominantly conversationally-focussed but that does not preclude other interfaces being used whenever they can add more value than a conversation.
