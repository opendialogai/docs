# Integrations introduction

OpenDialog provides two main integration points.

Firstly, you can use Actions to access outside information sources or decision engines and use that information within your conversational application.&#x20;

Secondly, you can integrate directly with our WebChat API and build a complete custom interface on top of that, embedding the chat capabilities within your own application.&#x20;
