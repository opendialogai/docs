# Conditions and operators

Conditions are a way that attributes can be used to shape the flow of the conversation. These conditions are essentially asking a question. If the answer to that question is yes, then the message is eligible for use in the conversation. The various questions being asked are called Operators.&#x20;

The Operators are:

<table data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Is True</td><td>Can be used with Boolean Attributes</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is equal to "True"</td></tr><tr><td>Is False</td><td>Can be used with Boolean Atrributes</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is equal to "False"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals</td><td>Can be used with Integer, Float, and String Attributes</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is equal to a set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Not Equals</td><td>Can be used with Integer, Float, and String Attributes</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is not equal to a set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Greater Than</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute with a numerical value</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is greater than the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Greater Than or Equal To</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute with a numerical value. </td><td>Checks if Attribute value is greater than or equal to the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Less Than</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute with a numerical value</td><td>Checks if Attribute value is less than the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Less Than or Equal To</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute with a numerical value. </td><td>Checks if Attribute value is less than or equal to the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Time Passed Equals</td><td>Can be used with last_seen Attribute</td><td>Checks if last_seen Attribute is equal to the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Time Passed Greater Than</td><td>Can be used with last_seen Attribute</td><td>Checks if last_seen Attribute is greater than the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Time Passed Less Than</td><td>Can be used with last_seen Attribute</td><td>Checks if last_seen Attribute is less than the set value in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Is Not Set</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute</td><td>Checks if the Attribute does not have a value set</td></tr><tr><td>Is Set</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute</td><td>Checks if the Attribute does have a value set</td></tr><tr><td>Is Empty</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute</td><td>Checks if the Attribute does not have a value</td></tr><tr><td>Is Not Empty</td><td>Can be used with any Attribute</td><td>Checks if the Attribute value does have a value</td></tr><tr><td>In Set</td><td>Can be used with String Attributes</td><td>Checks if the Attribute value includes the text value set in the condition</td></tr><tr><td>Not In Set</td><td>Can be used with String Attributes</td><td>Checks if the Attribute value does not include the text value set in the condition</td></tr></tbody></table>
