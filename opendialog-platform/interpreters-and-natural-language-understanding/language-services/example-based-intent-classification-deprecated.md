# Example-based intent classification \[Deprecated]

The OpenDialog Intent classifier is an LLM-powered intent classification service. It enables you to provide examples of phrases and entities and then classify intents based on that.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend the use of the [semantic classifier](semantic-intent-classifier/) going forward rather than the example phrase -based intent classifier.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
