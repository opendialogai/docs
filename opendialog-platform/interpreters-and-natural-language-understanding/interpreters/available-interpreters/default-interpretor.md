# Default interpreter

The default interpreter that comes out of the box with OpenDialog is useful primarily for button-driven or guided conversations.&#x20;

The input from a user clicking a button is sent to the default interpreter, and the interpreter then matches it to an intent.&#x20;

When it comes to natural language input however, we canâ€™t use the default interpreter; instead we use a natural language interpreter as discussed in the next pages.&#x20;
