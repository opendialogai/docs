# Conversation Hand-off

### **Where to find**

Conversation Handoff allows you to set up an integration with an external messaging system, for example, Chatwoot.  You can therefore find it under the Integrate section of a specific scenario. Once you select 'Create a new Handoff' you will then have the opportunity to create the Handoff of your choice.  Select Chatwoot to start setting up your Chatwoot integration.

* Select the scenario for which you would like to set up a conversation hand-off
* Use the left-hand menu and find the Integrate section right under the Interpret section&#x20;
* Expand the Integrate section to visualize the two options: Actions and Conversation Handovers.
* Select Conv. Handovers
