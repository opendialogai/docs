# Example dialog

`Bot: Is there anything else I can help you with?`

`User: No, that’s all.`&#x20;

`Bot: It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today.`&#x20;

`User: Likewise, this was strangely fun.`&#x20;

`Bot: Feel free to come back any time.`&#x20;

`User: Sure thing.`&#x20;

`Bot: Goodbye`

`User: Goodbye`

This sample starts with a last topic check, an opportunity to open up a new topic. After the user declines, the bot moves on to other pre-closing moves, including gratitude and a future contact offer. This proceeds smoothly. The bot says Goodbye, the first half of the final closing pair. When the user completes this pair with a Goodbye, the conversation has ended.
