# Select resources

The goal of this page is NOT to be a comprehensive list of resources on conversation design and UX. It is also not an endorsement (or lack thereof) of thought leaders and those who publish in the space. It is simply a list of resources that have been relevant to the conversation design team. Some of these resources are not specific to conversation design and instead focus on more traditional interfaces such as web and mobile app. There is much we can learn from these sources and apply to conversational interfaces.&#x20;

**Conversation design**

There are a number of valuable resources, both newer and older (and still very relevant), some more academic in nature, some less.&#x20;
