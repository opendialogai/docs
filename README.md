### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

> OpenDialog is a platform for designing and maintaining conversational AI Agents and Co-Pilots.

In a single, integrated environment you can quickly, easily, and safely design, manage and scale enterprise-grade AI agents and Co-Pilots without the need for deep AI or coding expertise.

With OpenDialog you can build sophisticated and user-friendly conversational agents that:

* provide users with automated support, answering their questions using your own documents and data sources through LLM-powered knowledge services and RAG.
* automate business processes through natural conversations that follow your rules through our uniquely flexible [Conversation Model](the-opendialog-model/).
* incorporate rich [web widgets](opendialog-platform/conversation-designer/message-design/message-types/) into the conversation to make the experience more engaging and use LLM-powered actions to reason about user inputs or generate output and customise how it behaves on your website through our [powerful SDK](developing-with-opendialog/webchat/sdk/).
* integrate with your own  systems through [Actions](developing-with-opendialog/actions/) and the Action API.
* integrate OpenDialog conversation capability into your own front-end applications through our [Chat API](developing-with-opendialog/webchat/webchat-api.md).
* gain deep understanding of how your application is performing through [Analytics](monitoring-your-application.md), tracking every decision and LLM call.&#x20;
