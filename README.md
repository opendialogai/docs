### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

> OpenDialog is a no-code platform with a unique methodology for designing, maintaining and scaling enterprise-grade conversational AI Agents and Co-Pilots quickly and safely.

From chatbots that answer questions using your own documents to powerful AI agents that integrate with your systems and execute complex tasks, OpenDialog enables you to get started quickly, scale effectively and maintain apps reliably over time.&#x20;

### Why use OpenDialog?

* OpenDialog makes it easy for non-technical people to take control of prompt engineering and user experience design with a beautiful no-code interface that supports sophisticated solutions while being easy to use.
* OpenDialog makes developer teams more efficient so you can release solutions faster. You can focus on your specific problem while OpenDialog handles all the issues that come with a GenAI tech-stack.&#x20;
* OpenDialog gives the business confidence to start with GenAI as it enables you to build applications that are safe and trustworthy with detailed analytics and auditing.

### What can you do with OpenDialog?

* design, manage and integrate [LLM prompts](opendialog-platform/interpreters-and-natural-language-understanding/llm-actions/) in your AI agent, powered by different LLM model providers.
* enhance your AI agent knowledge with your own documents with [vectorisation and RAG support](opendialog-platform/interpreters-and-natural-language-understanding/#semantic-search-and-rag).
* make [API calls](designing-conversations/actions/actions-from-library/) to your own applications and use that information in your AI apps.
* provide a [rich conversation-first web experience ](opendialog-platform/conversation-designer/message-design/message-types/)with chat, form widgets, payments, file uploads, maps, calendars and a [flexible SDK](developing-with-opendialog/webchat/sdk/) to customise and enhance..
* keep track of every interaction and every decision point gaining [rich analytics and a clearly auditable trace](monitoring-your-application.md).
* All of this in a no-code application builder that can scale with your needs from a few dozen conversations a day as you are prototyping to 100s of thousands.
