### Welcome to OpenDialog !

OpenDialog is a platform for building AI-powered conversational applications.&#x20;

With OpenDialog you can build sophisticated and user-friendly conversational agents that:

* provide users with automated support, answering their questions using your own documents and data sources through LLM-powered knowledge services and RAG.
* automate business processes through natural conversations that follow your rules through our novel [Conversation Model](the-opendialog-model/).
* incorporate rich [web widgets](opendialog-platform/conversation-designer/message-design/message-types/) into the conversation to make the experience more engaging and use LLM-powered actions to reason about user inputs or generate output.&#x20;
* integrate with your own  systems through [Actions](developping-with-opendialog/actions/) and the Action API.
* integrate OpenDialog conversation capability into your own front-end applications through our [Chat API](developping-with-opendialog/webchat/webchat-api.md).
* understand how your application is performing through [Analytics](monitoring-your-application.md).

Our documentation acts as a guide to the platform and the OpenDialog way of building conversational applications, but also as a broader reference for Conversational AI.
