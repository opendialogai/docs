# Release Notes

## September 2024

Significant milestone in OpenDIalog which brings you even more powerful way of building conversational applications!

#### <mark style="color:purple;">New Features</mark>

**Semantic Intent Classifier**

Remember our intent classifiers? Imagine a world when you can define simple list of your intents with few words of description what this about and thats it. No example phrases, nothing, any semantically matching user utterances will be classified as you want. Guess what? We did it! With our brand new semantic classifier you can do just this - specify list of intents, give it a description, choose an LLM engine which will be used to perform classification and use it in your scenario.

For more details check out documentation [here](https://docs.opendialog.ai/opendialog-platform/interpreters-and-natural-language-understanding/language-services/semantic-intent-classifier).

**RAG services**

We now have our very own support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which gives you ability to generate contextually relevant responses, based on a semantic search over a vectorised knowledge base. You can now use _your_ data to feed into your bots and use this knowledge to drive conversations. Want your users to be able to ask questions about where to find parking spot at your facility? No problem. You have complicated policy document and you want your bot to talk about its content? It's as easy for us as ABC. With our RAG service you can use any custom URL, pdf, csv, docx. xlsx or just simply drop us a text and we'll figure it out.

More in our docs [here](https://docs.opendialog.ai/opendialog-platform/interpreters-and-natural-language-understanding/language-services/retrieval-augmented-generation).

## August 2024

#### <mark style="color:purple;">New Features</mark>

We've been working hard to bring to you exciting new way to interact with LLMs what we call [LLM Actions](https://docs.opendialog.ai/opendialog-platform/interpreters-and-natural-language-understanding/llm-actions)! It's like a usual action which you can attach to an intent but which will leverage LLM to perform a task which you desire. Give it a system prompt, specify output attributes, configure moderation - with all of that you can make bot respond with dynamic messages, extract specific information from user utterance, format request to upstream webhook and much more. Check out documentation for detailed usage.
